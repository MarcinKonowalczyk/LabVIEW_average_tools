## ToDo's
### Easy ToDos
These can be done by absolutelly anyone. Some require LabVIEW, but none require much knowledge about it
 - Prettify README
 - Add assets folder and extract icons from vi's to use as glyphs
 - Fix typos (I'm not really paying attention as I write)


### More difficult ToDos
Things I'm not doing because they are not crucial yet, but I will eventually tick them off
 - ECOs in the error handler
 - Look at the code and see what else neeeds doing. Then put it on this very list.

### Hard ToDos
Basically things I do not know how to do myslef (either because they are difficult or because I have not spent much time researching how to actually get it done). Please help.
 - Make this into an actuall package on VIPM (When it's actually done of course)
 - Add fancy menu items
 - Does anyone know good way to write a vi which works with (any) queues?
